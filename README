========

Gravatar is a Javascript script to retrieve email associated gravatar picture or profile. It requires MooTools >= 1.2.

Features
--------

Gravatar features are:

* Dead simple to use
* Use user email MD5 for privacy
* Can use plain clear email if you don't care about privacy
* Creates multiple instances
* Fully customizable
* Works on Safari, Firefox, IE 6/7, Chrome and Opera
* Documentation generated with PDoc
* Open source, full code is available on BitBucket

Download
--------

* Full code is available from [BitBucket](http://www.bitbucket.org/Bounga/gravatar). If you want to fix bugs or add features, it's the best way to start with
* Full code is also available from a [zip file](http://www.bitbucket.org/Bounga/gravatar/get/tip.zip)

When the sources are retrieved you can build a compressed version of the lib using :

    $ rake
    
It'll build a YUI compressed version of the lib in 'dist' directory. You'll also got HTML code documentation in 'doc' directory.

Usage Example
-------------

Drop **mootools**, **md5** and **gravatar.js** in your javascripts directory and include it in your XHTML layout :

    <script src="javascripts/mootools.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
    <script src="javascripts/md5.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
    <script src="javascripts/gravatar.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
  
then you can create new Gravatar instances :

    new Bounga.Gravatar({md5: "855c677aca7319a44da19fb583b9f320", size: 200, extension: '.png'});
or 
    new Bounga.Gravatar({email: "nico@bounga.org", size: 200, extension: '.png'});
  
Take a look at 'example' directory to see examples.
  
Options
-------

Available options to tune your Gravatar are:

    size: 100           // Default size you want to use for the picture.
		extension: '.jpg'   // Extension you want to use for the picture.
		rating: 'g'         // Rating level.
		defaultImage: null  // Default image to use
		email: null         // plain text email to use
		md5: null           // already MD5 hashed email (so much better for your users)

Events
------

Available events fired by Gravatar are:
  
    profileFetched        // Fired when profil JSON was successfully retrieved.
    profileFetchingFailed // Fired when profil JSON fetching failed.
